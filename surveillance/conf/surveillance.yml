      #OPTIONAL AND ADVANCED PER SCREEN OPTIONS, YOU CAN CONFIGURE THIS PER SCREEN, IF NOT CONFIGURED A DEFAULT VALUE WILL BE USED
      #NOT recommendeded to enable disable_probing_for_all_streams, it disables some autohealing functions of rpisurv
      #Also if using multiple screens, enabling this will slow down rotation of one screen to the next if there are unconnectable screens
      #This also disabled rpisurv only drawing the connectable screens using up all pixels. In other words, you will get a placeholder for an unconnectable stream instead of not showing at all
      #Roughly the same as the obsoleted keep_first_screen_layout in rpisurv v1.0
      #Defaults to False
      #disable_probing_for_all_streams: False

      #How many columns you want the program to use, it will autocalculate the amount of row needed based on the resolution of your screen
      #Default = 2
      #nr_of_columns: "2"

      #Autostretching makes sures all of your pixels will be uses to display streams, so you have a maximum surveillance area.
      #But this will probably destroy the aspect ratio of your last stream.
      #Defaults to False
      #autostretch: False

      #This is how long this screen will be shown each rotation.
      #If this is set to a very low value then it can happen that building up the active and/or the cached screen takes longer then this duration,
      #in that case the building and caching needs to finish first before timer will be expired and next screen is shown
      #Defaults to 20
      #duration: 60



#!!!Normal users do not need to edit this section!!!
advanced:
  ##Enable this option if you want to have a fixed width of all your camera streams,
  ##By default rpisurv autocalculates this value, this can cause streams to get "stretched",
  ##if this value exceeds the available width, rpisurv will fallback to autocalculation
  #fixed_width: 500

  ##Enable this option if you want to have a fixed height for all your camera streams,
  ##By default rpisurv autocalculates this value, this can cause streams to get "stretched",
  ##if this value exceeds the available height, rpisurv will fallback to autocalculation
  #fixed_height: 500

  #Rpisurv sends usage stats to it's statistics server to give the rpisurv community an idea how widespread this software is being used
  #No performance impact is measured when using this option, no sensitive data is being sent. All data is anonymised.
  #By default this is false
  #update_stats: False

  #By default rpisurv will cache the next screen in the rotation (if more than one screen is configured), to speed up rotation events.
  #However, this action takes up some resources of the raspberry pi.
  #If you do not mind a slower rotate event (slower building up of the screen during a rotate event) and you want to free up some resources, then set this to False
  #This will also speed up first start since no cached screen needs to be started at boot time.
  #cache_next_screen: True

  #By default rpisurv checks every 19 seconds since start of rpisurv if it needs to redraw the current running screen
  #interval_check_status: 19

  #By default rpisurv will check memory usage, set to False to skip memory usage check
  #memory_usage_check: True

#These are fallbacks if autodetection fails;
#Normally you do not need to configure these
fallbacks:
  resolution:
    width: "1920"
    height: "1080"
